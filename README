Many ideas and algorithm for this plugin had been derived from the fantastic
Atmolight-plugin for the Video Disk Recorder (VDR) that was developed by
Eike Edener.


Description:
------------
The "atmo" post plugin analyze the video picture and generates
output data for so called "atmolight" controllers.

For detailed informations about "atmolight" visit the VDR-Wiki:
	http://www.vdr-wiki.de/wiki/index.php/Atmo-plugin
	http://www.vdr-wiki.de/wiki/index.php/DF10CH

This project is hosted at:
	http://projects.vdr-developer.org/projects/show/xine-lib-atmolight

!!!NOTE!!!!
Currently this plugin supports only grabbing of video from VDPAU
enabled devices!


Requirements:
-------------

Actual xine-lib-1.2 release:
	http://hg.debian.org/hg/xine-lib/xine-lib-1.2

The xine-lib-1.2 library must have the vdpau extension patches
version v15 or greater applied from here:
	http://www.vdr-portal.de/board/thread.php?threadid=86804

For compiling the plugin the xine-lib and libusb-1.0 development
files have to be installed. On debian based systems these are
packages libxine-dev and libusb-1.0-0-dev.


Compiling and installation:
---------------------------

make
make install


Configuration:
--------------

Load this plugin as a post plugin in your xine based media player.
For the VDR xineliboutput player or xine-ui player add a command line option like this:

--post=atmo:driver=classic,driver_param=/dev/ttyS0,top=1,bottom=1,left=1,right=1,center=1

When using DF10CH controller(s):

--post atmo:driver=df10ch


Parameters understood by this plugin:
-------------------------------------

The plugin stores the actual parameter setting in the xinelib config file
under the key 'post.atmo.parameters'.
Plugin parameters specified at the command line are mandatory and always
override the parameters stored in the xinelib config file at startup time.
You should specify all static parameters like output driver or section layout
at the command line.
Parameters that you wish to trim while player is running should not be specified within the
command line. Players like xine-ui have GUI support for changing plugin parameters
(press <alt><shift>p to show the post processing panel). 
Changes of Parameters marked with * will be immediately applied while player is running.
The other parameters will be applied after a stream close/open sequence (this happens already
when switching a channel within VDR).

                                    file:    File name of output file. If not specified
                                             "xine_atmo_data.out" is used.
                                             
                                    classic, df4ch:
                                             Path of serial device e.g. /dev/ttyS0
                                             For users with usb-to-serial converters the
                                             device could be specified as a regular expression
                                             that is looked up in /proc/tty/driver/usbserial to
                                             evaluate the /dev/ttyUSB device. The parameter must
                                             start with "usb:" followed by the regular expression
                                             e.g.: usb:pl2303.*usb-.*-[^6]

bottom_right       0                Number of sections (RGB channel groups) in area.
                                    For top, bottom, left and right area more then one section could be
                                    specified.
                                    Valid values: 0 ... 25 for top, bottom, left, right
                                    Valid values: 0 ... 1 for center, top_left, top_right, bottom_left, bottom_right

                                    NOTE!!!: Starting from plugin version 0.3 for "classic" controllers you must define one
                                    section for area top, bottom, left, right and center as plugin parameter!!!
                                    
                                    For DF10CH controller you do not have to specify these parameters here because they are read
                                    from the controller configuration data. Use the DF10CH setup program to configure your
                                    desired layout.
                                    
                                    
analyze_rate *     35               Rate of frame grabbing and video analysis. Unit milliseconds.
                                    Valid values: 10 ... 500

analyze_size *     1                Size of analyze window. The window width is calculated by (analyze_size+1)*64 pixel.
                                    The window height is calculated aspect correct according to the grabbed video
                                    window size. So a analyze size of 1 for a 16:9 video will give us a 128x72 pixel
                                    analyze window.
                                    Valid values: 0 ... 3

                                    For DF10CH controller you do not have to specify this parameter here because it is read
                                    from the controller configuration data. Use the DF10CH setup program to configure your
                                    desired analyze size.
                                    
overscan *         30               Ignored overscan border of grabbed video frame.
                                    Unit is percentage of 1000. e.g. 30 -> 3%
                                    Valid values: 0 ... 200

                                    For DF10CH controller you do not have to specify this parameter here because it is read
                                    from the controller configuration data. Use the DF10CH setup program to configure your
                                    desired overscan.
                                    
edge_weighting *   60               Power of edge weighting.
																		Value is divided by 10 e.g. 80 -> power of 8
																		Valid values 10 ... 200

                                    For DF10CH controller you do not have to specify this parameter here because it is read
                                    from the controller configuration data. Use the DF10CH setup program to configure your
                                    desired edge weighting.

darkness_limit *   1                Minimum brightness of pixel. Values below are interpreted as black pixel.
                                    Used to detect and skip "black borders" in video.
                                    Valid values are 0 ... 100

hue_win_size *     3                Windowing size for HUE. Valid values 0 ... 5

sat_win_size *     3                Windowing size for saturation. Valid values 0 ... 5

hue_treshold	*		 93								Threshold limit for change of color.
																		Unit percentage of 100. Valid values 1 ... 100
																		 
brightness	*      100              Controls brightness of generated color values.
                                    Unit percentage of 100. Valid values 50 ... 300
                                    
                                    Note: When using DF10CH controller(s) it is better to use the white calibration or
                                    common brightness feature of the DF10CH setup program instead of this
                                    parameter because you will lose lesser or no PWM resolution.

uniform_brightness * 0              Enable/Disable uniform brightness calculation.
                                    Valid values: 0 (disable), 1 (enable)
                                    When enabled only one uniform average brightness value is calculated
                                    for all sections. This is the behavior of the "classic"
                                    VDR Atmolight plugin.
                                    When disabled a average brightness value is calculated for each
                                    section. This mode is more suitable when many sections for a area exists.   
                                    
filter *           combined         Select smoothness filter. Currently there are two filters
                                    supported: percentage and combined.
                                    Valid values: off, percentage, combined

filter_smoothness * 50              Controls filter smoothness of percentage filter.
                                    Unit percentage of 100. Valid values 1 ... 100

filter_length *    500              Controls filter length of combined filter.
                                    Unit milliseconds. Valid values 300 ... 5000

filter_threshold * 40               Controls filter threshold of combined filter.
                                    Unit percentage of 100. Valid values 1 ... 100

filter_delay *     0                Controls delay of output send to controller.
                                    Unit milliseconds. Valid values 0 ... 1000
                                    Note: Delay should be specified as multiples of 20ms
                                                                        
wc_red
wc_green
wc_blue *          255              White calibration values for red, green and blue channel.
                                    Valid values 0 ... 255.
                                    
                                    Note: When using DF10CH controller(s) it is better to use the white calibration 
                                    feature of the DF10CH setup program instead of this parameter because you will
                                    lose lesser PWM resolution.

gamma *            0                Gamma correction factor for red, green and blue channel.
                                    Value is divided by 10 e.g. 25 -> gamma 2.5
                                    Valid values 0 ... 50. 0 means no gamma correction
                                    
                                    Note: When using DF10CH controller(s) it is better to use the gamma calibration 
                                    feature of the DF10CH setup program instead of this parameter because you will not
                                    lose PWM resolution.

start_delay *      250              Delay after stream start before first output is send [ms].
                                    Valid values 0 ... 5000.

enabled *          1                Enable/Disable output of color values to atmolight controller.
                                    Valid values: 0 (disable), 1 (enable)

Additional patches located in sub directory 'patches':
------------------------------------------------------

xine-ui-atmolight-switch.patch

This is a patch for the xine-ui player that extends the player with a 'AtmolightEnable' command
to switch the Atmolight on/off.
The command can be bound to keyboard or LIRC keys but it is not supported by the remote interface.


xineliboutput-atmolight-switch.patch

This is a patch for the xineliboutput player that extends the player with a 'Atmolight' command
to switch the Atmolight on/off.
Send slave command "Atmolight" for toggling on/off, "Atmolight 0" for switching off or "Atmolight 1"
for switching on.
Also pressing keyboard key 'a' or sending LIRC command 'Atmolight' toggles the Atmolight.
